    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      How can you go wrong with a side of mashed potatoes. Sometimes it can even
      be it's own meal if you want.
    </p>
    <p>There's not a whole lot more I can really say. Let's dive in.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>8 large potatoes</li>
      <li>1/2 cup of softened butter</li>
      <li>1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1.5 cups of buttermilk</li>
      <li>1 cup of heavy cream, or more to taste</li>
      <li>1 bunch flat leaf parsley, roughly chopped</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Slice all potatoes in half, place in a large pan, and cover with cool
        water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring to a boil for 25 to 35 minutes or until potatoes are tender enough
        to mash.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain water and add remaining ingredients. The parsley cooks slightly
        with the heat of the potatoes.
      </li>
      <li>Mash by hand or with a hand mixer.</li>
      <li>Add salt to taste</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
