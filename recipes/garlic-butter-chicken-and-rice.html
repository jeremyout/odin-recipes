    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This is one of my go-to dishes. It tastes great and doesn't take that long
      to make.
    </p>
    <p>
      You only need a few ingredients and some seasonings, let's dig in on how
      to make it.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 large chicken breasts</li>
      <li>1/2 cup of grated parmesan</li>
      <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      <li>1tsp Paprika</li>
      <li>1Tbsp Italian Seasoning</li>
      <li>4Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
      <li>
        1 head of Cauliflower, riced. (I just use frozen cauliflower rice)
      </li>
      <li>1/2 cup of chopped white onion</li>
      <li>2Tbsp of vegetable stock</li>
      <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
      <li>Red pepper flakes, optional</li>
      <li>1/4 cup of parsely, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h4>Chicken</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Halve your chicken breast to get 4 smaller pieces</li>
      <li>
        In a shallow plate, combine parmesan cheese, 1/2 of your grated garlic,
        paprika, and Italian seasoning. Season the chicken breasts with salt and
        pepper; dredge in the parmesan mixture; shake off excess and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large non-stick skillet melt 2 tablespoons of butter over
        medium-high heat. Cook chicken cutlets until golden on each side and
        cooked through - about 3-4 minutes for each side, depending on the
        thickness of your chicken cutlets. Transfer to a plate.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Cauliflower Rice</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In the same pan, melt 2 tablespoons of butter. Fry the remaining garlic
        and your onion for 1 minute until fragrant â€” be careful not to burn.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the riced cauliflower to the skillet and stir to mix everything
        together well and coat in melted butter. Cook, stirring regularly for 1
        minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the 2 tablespoons vegetable stock, about half the parsley, and
        lemon zest (if using). Cook the cauliflower rice for one minute to
        reduce juices then add the lemon juice and a few sprinkles of leftover
        parmesan cheese, if you like.
      </li>
      <li>
        Adjust seasoning as needed. Stir in the remaining parsley. Return
        chicken breasts over cauliflower rice and reheat quickly. Serve your
        parmesan chicken with fresh cracked black pepper, red chili pepper
        flakes, and more parmesan.
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> Make sure to use a non-stick pan otherwise the
      parmesan might stick.
